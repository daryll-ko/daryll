# Yahallo!

I'm <span className="text-yellow-200">Daryll</span>. I program and do research for fun.

I'm currently a Computer Science major in the [University of the Philippines Diliman](https://upd.edu.ph/).

I work under the [Algorithms and Complexity Lab](https://aclab.dcs.upd.edu.ph/), where I look into unconventional models and algorithms surrounding these models.

Inside computer science, I'm also into **numerical computing** and **programming languages**.

Outside computer science, I'm also into **language acquisition** (Japanese/<JP>日本語</JP> in particular) and **math**.

Aside than that, I'm not into sports.
